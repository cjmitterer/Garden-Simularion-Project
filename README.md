This is a garden design program for the Native Plants of Delaware. The goal of the program is to design a garden that will support the highest possible number of leps. Our garden design program first allows the user to decide whether to start a new garden or open an existing one. For new gardens, the user is then expected to insert in all of their personal garden needs: garden size, soil content, moisture levels, sunlight levels, and their budget. Once every field is filled out, the user can create their garden.

After the garden is created, the user is directed to the garden screen. On the garden screen there is a menu on the left side which holds all the plants that match the users requirements from the previous screen. The user is able to drag and drop plants onto the garden in any location they prefer. Once a plant is added, the user's budget and the garden's lep count is updated in the top right corner of the screen. At any point the user can click on the Current Plants tab to see how many of each plant is currently in the garden and the total number of leps supported from each plant. If the user decides they no longer want a plant, they can simply right click on it to remove it from the garden. Currently, this program supports 100 native plants.
